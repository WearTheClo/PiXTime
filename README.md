# Time Series Forecasting

This project implements time series forecasting models using PyTorch and NumPy.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Install PyTorch and NumPy:
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

### Dataset
1. Download the dataset from [[link]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy)
2. Place the dataset in the `dataset` folder

**Acknowledgement**: We would like to thank the Autoformer project team for organizing and providing the dataset. Their project is available at: https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer?tab=readme-ov-file

## Usage

To run the experiments, simply execute the corresponding `.sh` batch file for each model. This will reproduce the experimental results as shown below:

```bash
# Example - run the specific model script
./run_model.sh
```

## Experimental Results

The results obtained from running the models will be displayed in the format shown below:

[Experimental results will be displayed here]

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts
- Verify the dataset is correctly placed in the `dataset` folder
- Each model has its own batch file for easy execution
